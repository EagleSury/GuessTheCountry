Hi Y'all! 
So glad you're trying out my game! 

Do you know your flags????!?!?!?
If you do, you're good to go!

How do you run it? 
It's simple: 
  Open GuessTheCountry.py in a codespace, 
  Run "flask run"  in the terminal, 
  Click yes if a warning pops up.

That should open it up in your browser!  

Enjoy!!!
