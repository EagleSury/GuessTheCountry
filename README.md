Hi Y'all!
So glad you're trying my game out!

Do you know you're flags????!?!?!?
If you do, you're good to go!

How do you run it?
It's simple:
  Open GuessTheCountry.py in a codespace, 
  Run "python GuesstheCountry.py"  in the terminal
  Click yes if a warning pops up.

That should open it up in your browser!

Enjoy!!!
