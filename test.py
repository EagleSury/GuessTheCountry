I know I'm supposed to be testing over here (and for sure not deleting flags...).
When I run "assert flag.country in flag.flag", I get a few errors, where the flag_url doesn't contain the country name.
When I run "if flag.country not in flag.flag" - the else statement never gets executed - which would mean that every flag contains the country name. 
I checked the database, and there are flags that don't have the country name. 
I tried running the app with those flags as the chosen flag, and it worked perfectly.
I don't really know what to test here then...
